# Final Project
For my final project, I designed potential passenger rail corridors for the state of Virginia. I based my decisions using an ArcGIS Insights tool I created (embedded below) using [2016-2020 ACS 5-year commuting estimates](https://www.census.gov/data/tables/2020/demo/metro-micro/commuting-flows-2020.html) and a raster analysis I conducted using Esri data and the Enrich tool to target underserved and high-potential areas for rail.
