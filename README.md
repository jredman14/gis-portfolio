# My Spatial Data Science with ArcGIS Pro Portfolio
My portfolio of projects created in my Spatial Data Science with ArcGIS Pro class at CMU.

# About me
My name is Justin, and I'm currently working toward my Master of Science in Public Policy and Management at Carnegie Mellon's Heinz College. I have a deep background in GIS and data analysis, and I am excited for the opportunity to share my work with you as I dive further into spatial data science. Ultimately, my goal is to apply my knowledge of GIS - and other quantitative and analytical tools - to a career in public service.

Thank you for viewing my portfolio! 

# What I hope to learn
I hope to continue building my analytical skillset and learn more applications of ESRI's software and other geospatial programs.
